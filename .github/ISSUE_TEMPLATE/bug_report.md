# Summary

Replace this with a short summary (one sentence or short paragraph) of the issue you are seeing.

## What I did

Explain the steps you undertook that led to the unexpected behavior you are observing. Please include relevant documentation snippets, such as the `S3_*` settings from Tutor’s `config.yml`.

It’s OK to remove or mask credentials (like your `OPENEDX_AWS_*` settings), but otherwise try to err on the side of sharing more rather than less information.

## What I expected to happen

Explain how you expected Tutor to behave with your configuration.

## What actually happened

Explain how Tutor behaved differently than you expected.

## My environment

Please add some information about the environment that you’re working in. At a minimum, include these items:

* Tutor version: (Insert the Tutor version you are using.)
* `tutor-contrib-s3` version: (Insert the plugin version you are using. If you installed from Git, enter the tag or branch name, or the commit reference.)

Additionally, you might also want to add any of the items below, if you think they might be relevant to the bug:

* Kubernetes versions: (If you are reporting a bug that applies to deploying this plugin with `tutor k8s`, add your `kubectl version` output. Otherwise, remove this item.)
* Docker/Podman version: (If you are running `tutor local`, the output of `docker version` might be relevant.)
* Platform details: (Some issues are specific to individual cloud platforms. It may help if you could include whether you’re running on AWS, on OpenStack, on Digital Ocean etc.)
* S3 implementation details: (Some issues are specific to AWS S3, others to Ceph Object Gateway, others to other S3 implementations. It may help if you could include some details about what runs your S3 API.)

## Additional context

If there’s any other context you’d like to share, please add it here. Otherwise, you can delete this section.
